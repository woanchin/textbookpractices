Give advantages and disadvantages of a parallel programming model over a distributed system (message
-based) system.

NOTE: Answers derived largely from the book 'Concurrent and Distributed Computing in Java' and 
Stack Overflow. Credits go to them. 

Parallel Programming Model
	Advantages
		1. Generally faster to update a shared memory location than to send a message to another 
		   processor.
		2. More efficient to get fine-grain parallelism from a parallel system than from a 
		   distributed system.
	Disadvantages
		1. Shared memory becomes a bottleneck when the number of processors is increased
Distributed System Model
	Advantages
		1. Distributed Systems are more scalable than parallel systems
		2. More flexible because a single processor can be modified (added/deleted) easily. The
		   added proccessor can be completely different.
		3. Multiple organizations can share data with one another.
		4. Multiple organizations can share expensive equipment together.
		5. Distributed systems are more fail proof because the failure of one single computer does 
		   not compromise the entire ecosystem.
		6. Availability of high bandwidth networks infrastructure favors distributed computing 
	Disadvantages
		1. Messages can be lost in the network system. Communication breakdown.
		2.
